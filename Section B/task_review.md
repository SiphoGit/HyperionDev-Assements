# Recursion Task Review

Thank you for submitting Sipho. You've laid a good foundation for your program and you clearly understand Java syntax. However, there are a few aspects of your submission that need to be fixed before I can mark your task complete.

### Correctness
Remember, a recursive function is a function that calls itself. You are calling an undefined method called "reverseString", in line 28, to perform recursion. You also have a method "function", in line 30, which you never call. An example of how recursion works: [here](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_recursion.asp) 

### Efficiency
Unfortunately, your program does not meet the requirements of this task. Please make the corrections mentioned above and resubmit

### Style

The blank lines between your code are inconsistent. A guide on how to space your code: [Here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-whitespace.html)

In line 32 you've defined a variable "maxNumber" which is already defined as an argument for your method. Please make sure that you don't define different variables with the same name.

Lastly, your for loop in line 38 is not properly indented.

### Documentation
You have commented on your code properly which makes it easy to understand. Keep it up! :)

### Positive 
Great work Sipho. Please fix the errors mentioned above and resubmit.
